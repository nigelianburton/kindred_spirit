        "role": "Pentagon Papers whistleblower",
        "quote": "There are certain secrets that are so important to expose that you must be willing to risk your career, your freedom, even your life. When institutions become corrupt, the only way to preserve democracy is to let the truth see daylight, regardless of the personal cost."

        "years": "1729-1797",
        "role": "Irish statesman and philosopher",
        "quote": "Order and stability require trust within institutions. When individuals take it upon themselves to violate oaths and confidences, they undermine the very foundations of civil society. Reform must come through proper channels, not through betrayal of sacred commitments."

        "role": "35th U.S. President",
        "quote": "We have a responsibility to protect our children and citizens from preventable violence. Other nations have proven that sensible firearm regulations save lives without eliminating freedom. The right to life must be balanced against the right to bear arms."

        "quote": "The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government. When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny."

        "quote": "The one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin would be to permit it to become a tangle of squabbling nationalities. We can have no divided allegiance here. We must insist upon undiluted Americanism. A nation that cannot control its borders will cease to be a nation."

        "role": "American writer and civil rights activist",
        "quote": "Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced. Words have power—they reveal character. Those who harm with language must understand there are consequences. Accountability is not cruelty; it is how we build a more just world."

        "role": "South African anti-apartheid revolutionary and president",
        "quote": "Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies. I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. If I could forgive my jailers, surely we can allow others to grow beyond their past mistakes. Redemption must be possible."

        "quote": "It is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong. Five lives hold more happiness, more potential, more love than one. The calculus is clear: we must act to minimize suffering. Inaction when action could save more lives is itself a moral failure."

        "role": "Catholic Pope, moral philosopher",
        "quote": "One may never do evil so that good may result from it. To deliberately kill an innocent person, even to save others, is to treat human life as a means rather than an end. We are not the masters of life and death. Our hands must remain clean, even when the consequences break our hearts."

        "quote": "What is not good for the swarm is not good for the bee. We are all part of the human family. To privilege one life—even one we love—over the many is to fail in our duty to humanity. The Stoic accepts this harsh truth: justice must be impartial, even when it tears the heart."

        "role": "Danish philosopher, theologian",
        "quote": "Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac was praised, yet the universal ethic condemns murder. This is the paradox: particular relationships transcend universal duty. A father who would not save his child for five strangers is not immoral—he is human. Love demands the impossible, and we must live with that tension."

        "quote": "When a madman is driving a car on the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, the ultimate question is not whether I tell him the truth about his direction, but whether I wrestle the steering wheel away from him. There are times when telling the truth is a betrayal of truth itself. When the state becomes criminal, conscience demands resistance."

        "role": "German philosopher",
        "quote": "A lie always harms another; even if it helps one person, it harms humanity itself by making the source of truth unreliable. To lie to an authority, even a corrupt one, is to undermine the very possibility of trust and justice. You have no right to assume the consequences of your honesty will be worse than your deception."

The law is not a light for you or any man to see by; the law is not an instrument of any kind. The law is a causeway upon which the citizen may walk safely. We must not betray it, even for friendship."

        "role": "French novelist and poet",
        "quote": "What is history? An echo of the past in the future; a reflex from the future on the past. Jean Valjean stole bread and was punished for life—until someone showed him mercy. True justice recognizes transformation. To condemn the redeemed is to deny the possibility of human goodness. Society must allow for second chances."
