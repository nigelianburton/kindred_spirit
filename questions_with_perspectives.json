We are free when our actions flow from our own desires, beliefs, and intentions—even if those were caused by prior events. The question is not whether you could have done otherwise in some absolute sense, but whether you are the kind of being whose actions respond to reasons. Punishment is justified when it helps maintain a system that makes us more responsive to moral reasons."

When someone is publicly degraded on account of their race or religion, they are being told that they are not to be treated as equals. The harm is not just to feelings, but to dignity and to the public good of a society where everyone can participate on equal terms."

Who decides what is hateful? The powerful. Throughout history, censorship has been wielded by those in power against dissidents and minorities. The remedy for bad speech is more speech, not censorship."
